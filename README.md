# What are we building?

We'll be working with several flavors of the [Northwind Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/downloading-sample-databases), which Microsoft uses to demonstrate a wide range of features across their MS Access and MS SQL Server product lines. You'll be writing some application code in a small [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) web application (built with [Express](https://expressjs.com)) to view and make changes to this data.

Here's what it looks like (and [here](https://damp-oasis-38940.herokuapp.com/) is a live demo):

This app is not in a good state at the beginning of the workshop. Features are missing, there are major performances, and quite a few database-related bugs. We'll fix all these problems and learn as we go!

# Deploy this app on heroku

If you don't want to set up your own [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) database locally, you can deploy this app onto heroku and use their free (up to 10k records) hosted PostgreSQL service.
